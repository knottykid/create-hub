Combining what we've learned in class about **Backend:, Nodejs, Express, MongoDB, Handlebars and Axios** , 
plus the individual inputs of each (*forEach*)

Tom & John created a type of forum for creative people, 
where you can share your passion,  own art or favorite topic to talk about.
Using CRUD we manage to make all the functionalities and logic of the backend, 
and made a REST API that fetch informations from the server Data Base and the use of external API for extra info of the topics.
